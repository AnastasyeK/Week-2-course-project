This assignment focuses on analysing activity monitoing data from 5 minute intervals throughout the day which were measured for 2 months 
between October and November 2012. 

The data contains the following parameters:

steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as NA)
date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken

Assignments objectives were to create the following analysis / plots:

1. Code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data
2. Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
3. Mean and median number of steps taken each day
4. Time series plot of the average number of steps taken
5. The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps
6. Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data
7. Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed
8. Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends
9. All of the R code needed to reproduce the results (numbers, plots, etc.) in the report

Note:
Unfortunately I was unable to upload my completed .html file (it was showing up as a completely different code chunk) and so I 
uploaded the URL to my document instead. I appologize for this format, I know that it is not the proper submission format.
